# NodeJS Tutorial

This repo is for storing the code and notes for the NodeJS tutorial on YouTube.
In this tutorial I learnt about following things:

- [NodeJS Basics - Modules, File System, Streams](./tutorial%201/)
- [Node Web Server - Requests and Responses](./tutorial%202/)
- [ExpressJS- Routing, EJS, Middleware](./express/)
- MongoDB/Mongoose ODM


On completion of this tutorial, I have created a simple blog website using NodeJS and ExpressJS.
